# midi-unit-test-cases

[midi-unit-test-cases](http://shkyrockett.github.io/midi-unit-test-cases/)
is a start at collecting a set of minimal unit test case midi files, for use in testing standard midi file parsing.

These test cases aren't supposed to sound pretty. The are just supposed to test features of the SMF Midi standard. The hope is to create test cases that contain the minimum set of instructions in each test case to test a particular feature, or scenario so that midi parsers can be written iteratively. 

This set of test cases is a work in progress and barely covers a tiny piece of the spec.
